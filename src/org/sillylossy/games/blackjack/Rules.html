<p>
    Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack is a
    comparing card game between a player and dealer, meaning players compete against the dealer but not against other
    players. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one
    of the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack"), without a dealer blackjack;
    </li>

    <li>
        Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
    </li>

    <li>
        Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The player or players are dealt a two-card hand and add together the value of their cards. Face cards (kings,
    queens,
    and jacks) are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count an ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other
    cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their first two cards, players have the
    option of getting a "hit", or taking an additional card. In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having
    a score of 21 or by having the higher score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (called "busting" or "going
    bust") results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts.
    If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called "soft", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking
    an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card will always be less than or equal to 21. Otherwise, the hand
    is "hard".
</p>
<p>
    The dealer must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At many tables the dealer also hits on a "soft" 17,
    i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a
    total higher than the dealer's. The dealer loses by busting or having a lesser hand than the player who has not
    busted. If the player and dealer have the same total, this is called a "push", and the player typically does not
    win or lose money on that hand. If all available players bust, the hand ends automatically without the dealer having
    to play his or her hand.
</p>
<p>
    The players' object is to win money by creating card totals that turn out to be higher than the dealer's hand but do
    not exceed 21 ("busting"/"breaking"), or alternatively by allowing the dealer to take additional cards until he/she
    busts. On their turn, players must choose whether to "hit" (take a card), "stand" (end their turn), "double" (double
    wager, take a single card and finish) or "surrender" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards
    count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as "face cards" or "pictures") count as 10; aces
    are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and
    all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After player have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by
    drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace, or
    "soft 17", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or
    surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet
    wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd
    card it is considered a "natural 21" or "blackjack" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a
    natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as "push", bets are normally returned
    without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. An
    outcome of blackjack vs. blackjack results in a push. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for
    winning blackjacks, which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (one-and-a-half times the wager).
