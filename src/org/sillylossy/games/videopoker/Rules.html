<h1>Video poker</h1>
<p>
    Play begins by placing a bet. Bet is a part of player's score. The player is then given 5 cards (as the game plays
    similar to five-card draw) and has the opportunity to discard one or more of them in exchange for new ones drawn
    from the same virtual deck. After the draw, the game pays out if the hand or hands played match one of the winning
    combinations, which are posted in the pay table. Unlike the table version, the player may discard all 5 of their
    original cards if they so choose.

    Pay tables allocate the payouts for hands and are based on how rare they are. A pay table starts with a minimum hand
    of a pair of jacks, which pays even money. All the other hand combinations in video poker are the same as in table
    poker, including such hands as two pair, three of a kind, straight (a sequence of 5 cards of consecutive value),
    flush (any 5 cards of the same suit), full house (a pair and a three of a kind), four of a kind (four cards of the
    same value), straight flush (5 consecutive cards of the same suit) and royal flush (a Ten, a Jack, a Queen, a King
    and an Ace of the same suit).
